<h2>What is B-Translator</h2>

<p>The codename <b>B-Translator</b> can be decoded like <b>Bee
Translator</b>, since it aims at collecting very small translation
contributions from a wide crowd of people and to dilute them into
something useful. It can also be decoded like <b>Be Translator</b>, as
an invitation to anybody to give his small contribution for
translating programs or making their translations better.</p>
