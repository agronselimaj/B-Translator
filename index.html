<h2 id="sec-2"> What is B-Translator </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
The codename <b>B-Translator</b> can be decoded like <b>Bee Translator</b>,
since it aims at collecting very small translation contributions
from a wide crowd of people and to dilute them into something
useful.
</p>
<p>
It can also be decoded like <b>Be Translator</b>, as an invitation to
anybody to give his small contribution for translating programs or
making their translations better.
</p>
<p>
If you could come up with some other interesting explanations,
please let me know.
